## TEMPLATE

### Description

This project is a simple template that integrates some of MuleSoft best practices. It provides a set of standard minimalistic tools that should help you start your project quickly/efficiently.

  - **Plugins**
      - mule-maven-plugin: enriched with a configuration that goes along with the Jenkinsfile (pipeline).
      - maven-release-plugin: maven release management tool see the **Release** section for more information on how to use it
  - **Structure**
      - Separation between interface and implementation
      - Global configuration file
      - Resources
          - property files: 
            - common property file containing environment variable common to all environments (sandbox to production) like http port, basePath etc ...
            - jsonlogger property files, used to configure the JSON Logger plugin
            - a property file for each environment DEV/QA/UAT. You can add as many as you want (just don't forget to update the jenkinsfile)
  - **Dependencies** Your organisation should add the following dependencies to exchange.
      - json-logger
      - common-error-handler
  - **CI/CD**
      - Jenkinsfile: a generic premade pipeline. Instructions to building the jenkins server are located in `ci-cd_setup.md` file.

### INSTANTIATE

Make sure the `instantiate.sh` file is executable
```bash
$ chmod +x instantiate.sh
```

Below is how to use the instantiation script:

```bash
$ ./instantiate.sh [api-name] [group-id] [group-name] [api-repo-url] [maven-settings-id] [anypoint-host] [region]
```

Where the options are: 

| parameters    | description    | example       | default    |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|------------|
|`api-name`     |**required** the name of the new project| my-project-name | |
|`group-id`     |The business group id (cloudhub). | 0aefazeg0aazera2 |  |
|`group-name`   |The business group name (cloudhub)| MyBusinessGroup  | |
|`api-repo-url` |The repository url (ssh or http) of the api| git@github:user/repository.git | |
|`maven-settings-id` | The Id of Maven global settings in jenkins. Refer to the `ci-cd_setup.md` file for more information on how to setup this id along with the pipeline.| `my-maven-global-settings` | maven-global-settings|
|`anypoint-host`  | The anypoint host | anypoint.mulesoft.com | anypoint.mulesoft.com |
|`region`         | The anypoint region |Â eu-central-1 | us-east-1 |


> **Note:** that parameters should be given in the **right order**. Only the `api-name` is required.

$ ./instantiate.sh  \
      my-api-name \
      07ac71-97cb-46c0-ad91-105eb78e8 \
      myBusinessGroupName \
      git@github:user/repository.git \  
      maven-settings-id \
      eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com \
      eu-central-1
```

The new project will be created in the same folder as the template folder. 

## RELEASE

In order to prepare a release, execute the following : 

```bash
mvn release:clean release:prepare 
```

You will be prompted to answer a few questions about the release: 

  1) **What is the release version for ...**: the name of the release. should be something like `X.X.X`. Hit enter to accept the default
  2) **What is the SCM release tag or label for ...**: the name of the tag. The default nomenclature is `{project_name}-{version}`. Use the nomenclature `v{version}`, for example `v1.0.5`. Then hit enter.
  3) **What is the new development version for ...**: the development name or the upcoming version you will be working on (the SNAPSHOT version). It should end with `SNAPSHOT`. The pluging automatically increases the patch number. Hit enter. 

You will notice the following temporary files have been created in the root folder : 

  - **release.properties:** contains the release configuration (release tag etc ...)
  - **pom.xml.releaseBackup:** the old content of the `pom.xml` file with the previous release

After you've reviewed the release properties, execute the following to perform the release:

```bash
mvn release:perform 
```
